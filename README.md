# Travel-site-web-application-main

 Simple Travelling Website, a project I recently worked on that aims to simplify travel planning and exploration. Developed using JS, Node.js, and MongoDB, this client/server-based network/web application offers a seamless user experience.

The main goal of the the project was to learn and get familiar with dealing with server request/responses and dealing with a backend application like mongoDB.
With the Simple Travelling Website, users can effortlessly search for travel destinations, create accounts, and add places to their personalized "want-to-go" list. By leveraging the power of Express.js and VS Code, we've created a platform that enables users to discover new destinations and plan their dream trips.
